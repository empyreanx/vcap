/**
	\mainpage Vcap

	Vcap is a library written in C that aims to make using the Video4Linux2 API simple. It was designed to make the common 
	case of capturing frames using memory-mapped device buffers quick and easy.

	Vcap was also written with computer vision applications in mind and thus allows setting camera controls that enhance or
	interfere with computer vision and image processing techniques. Vcap also includes a (growing) number of pixel format
	decoding functions, enabling seamless support for many devices. 

	In contrast with similar projects, Vcap is licensed under the LGPL v2.1 which permits it's use in commercial products.
